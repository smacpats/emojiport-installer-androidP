# emojiport-installer-androidP
Using some source elements of Minimal Hosts blocker, I have made an installer for the Android P emoji file. This will get you the latest Android P emojis on iOS 10.x and 11.x. Basically, if you install this, it will download emojiport and the files, so you won’t need to worry about them. When it installs, it makes a backup of your current emoji file and uninstalling will restore the original emoji file. 


NOTE- Will not work on 10.x kppless jailbreaks.


Installation-

Make sure to add http://poomsmart.github.io/repo/ and http://smacpats.github.io/repo/ in your sources.

After that, search for “EmojiPort Installer (Android P emojis)” and install it. That should be it.
